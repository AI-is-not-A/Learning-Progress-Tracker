<h2>While loop</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Sometimes one <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6065" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Iteration in Python refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met or a specified number of repetitions is reached. | It can be categorized into definite iteration, where the number of repetitions is predetermined, and indefinite iteration, where the number of repetitions depends on a specified condition. Python provides built-in tools such as loops and iterators to facilitate iteration. Loops can be used to iterate over iterable objects, and iterators can be created from iterable objects to access their elements one by one.">iteration</a></strong> (=execution) of a statement is not enough to get the result you need. That is why Python offers a special <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5926" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A statement in Python is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a simple statement like an assignment or a complex statement like a function or class definition. Statements are executed sequentially, and each statement can affect the program's state. Python has various types of statements, including control flow statements, which alter the flow of execution, and data manipulation statements, which perform operations on data. Comments are not considered statements, as they are ignored by the Python interpreter.">statement</a> that will execute a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6270" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A block of code in Python refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> several times. Meet the <strong>loop </strong>command and one of the universal loops — the <strong>while </strong>loop.</p>
<p>People generally don't choose Python to write <strong>fast </strong>code. The main advantages of Python are readability and simplicity. As the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6065" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A while loop in Python is a control flow statement that allows for the repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. | It is less commonly used than other loop structures due to its slower execution time, but can be useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance. The condition for the loop is written before the body of the loop and is checked before each iteration.">while loop</a> </strong>requires the introduction of extra variables, iteration takes up more time. Thus, the while loop is quite slow and not that popular. It resembles a conditional <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operator in Python is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more values (operands) to produce a result. | Examples of operators include arithmetic operators like `+` and `-`, comparison operators like `&lt;` and `&gt;`, and logical operators like `and` and `or`.">operator</a>: using the while loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as the condition is true.</p>
<p>The <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a 'condition' typically refers to a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False. | Conditions are often used in control flow structures, such as if statements, to determine which code to execute based on the result of the condition.

It's important to note that 'continue' does not terminate the loop entirely; it only skips the current iteration and moves on to the next one.">continue</a>.

<p>If we visualize the while loop, it’ll look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">number = 0
while number &lt; 5:
    print(number)
    number += 1
print('Now, the number is equal to 5')</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code class="language-python">number</code> plays here the role of a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5872" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a 'counter' is a variable used in a loop to keep track of the number of iterations that have been completed. | It is often initialized to zero and incremented by one in each iteration of the loop. If the counter variable is not used within the loop, it can be replaced with an underscore to indicate that it is not being utilized. Counters are useful for repeating a function a specified number of times or for iterating over a collection a certain number of times. They are an essential part of programming in Python and many other languages.">counter</a> </strong>– a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5859" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A variable in Python is a named location used to store data in memory. | It is created when a name is bound to a value for the first time, and it can be assigned and reassigned different values throughout the execution of a program. Variables in Python follow specific naming rules, such as not starting with a digit, not being a keyword, and using underscores or digits. They are objects in Python, meaning they have a unique identity and are created, assigned, passed, and returned like any other object.">variable</a> that changes its value after each iteration. In this case, the iterations continue until the number is equal to 5 (note that the program outputs the value of the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8804" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a number is a value that can be used in arithmetic operations. | It can't be an abstract thing, like in math, because a computer should be able to work with it.

When the value of a counter reaches 5, the program control moves to the next operation and <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7139" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The 'print' function in Python is a built-in function used to output data to the standard output device (like a screen). | It can take various types of arguments, such as strings, integers, lists, etc. By default, the output is separated by spaces and ends with a newline.

<h5 id="the-infinite-loop" style="text-align: center;">The infinite loop</h5>
<p>If you delete a part of the conditional code where you increase the value of a counter, you will bump into the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6065" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An infinite loop in Python is a loop that keeps executing indefinitely because its condition never becomes false. | This can occur due to a logical error where the condition is always true, or when the condition is not updated within the loop, causing it to remain true forever. Infinite loops can cause a program to become unresponsive or consume excessive system resources, so they should be avoided or properly managed with loop control statements.">infinite loop</a>. </strong>What does it mean? Since you don’t increase your variable, a condition never becomes false and can work forever. Usually, it is a logical fallacy, and you'll have to stop the loop using special statements or finishing the loop manually.</p>
<p>Sometimes the infinite loop can be useful, e.g. in querying a client when the loop works continuously to provide the constant exchange of information with a user. You can implement it by writing <code class="language-python">True</code> as a condition after the <code class="language-python">while</code> header.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">while True:
    ...</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Now you are familiar with the <strong>while </strong>loop and its usage. Don’t forget about the role of a counter, otherwise, you’ll have to deal with the infinite loop. After you’ve written the code, try to "run" it as if you were a Python program. That’ll help you understand how the loop works.</p>
<p>Programming is all about simplification, so the code should be readable, short, and clear. Don’t forget about comments and syntax. In the beginning, it may seem that the while loop is not that easy to implement, but after a couple of times, you’ll see that it’s a very useful tool.</p>
